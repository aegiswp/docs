## Overview

Aegis uses an inline assets system to conditionally load CSS and JavaScript only when needed.

## How It Works

1. **Detection** - Aegis scans page content for blocks
2. **Matching** - Identifies which assets each block needs
3. **Loading** - Injects only required assets

## Benefits

- **Performance** - No unused CSS/JS loaded
- **Efficiency** - Smaller page sizes
- **Speed** - Faster page loads

## Asset Types

### CSS

Block-specific styles loaded inline or via `<style>` tags.

### JavaScript

Scripts loaded only when interactive blocks are present.

### Fonts

Fonts loaded based on typography selections in Global Styles.

## Configuration

Assets are managed through the InlineAssets service in `vendor/aegis/framework/src/InlineAssets/`.

<Tip>
This zero-asset-by-default approach is key to Aegis's performance philosophy.
