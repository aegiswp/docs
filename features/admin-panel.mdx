## Overview

Aegis provides a centralized admin panel under the **Aegis** menu in the WordPress dashboard. All theme features, blocks, and integrations are managed from this single location.

The admin panel is organized into six tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Dashboard** | Theme overview, version info, and quick links |
| **Blocks** | Enable or disable individual Aegis blocks |
| **Modals** | Manage modal blocks and view modal feature status |
| **Hooks** | Manage hook patterns and view available hooks |
| **Conditionals** | Enable or disable conditional logic groups |
| **Integrations** | Third-party plugin settings and feature toggles |

## Dashboard

The default landing page when clicking the Aegis menu. Displays:

- Theme version and update status
- Quick links to documentation and support
- Feature summary

## Blocks

Toggle individual Aegis blocks on or off. Disabled blocks are unregistered and will not appear in the block inserter.

Available blocks:

- **Slider** (`aegis/slider`) — Responsive carousel
- **Modal** (`aegis/modal`) — Dialog overlays

<Note>
When a block is disabled, its assets are not loaded and the block type is not registered.
</Note>

## Modals

A dedicated overview for the Modal block system:

- **Modal count** — Number of published modal blocks across the site
- **Active features** — Status of modal-related features (trigger types, animation, conditional display)
- **Add New** — Quick link to create a new post with a modal block
- **Manage All** — Link to the modal block list

## Hooks

Overview and management for [Hook Patterns](/features/hook-patterns):

- **Active count** — Number of enabled hook patterns
- **Add New** — Create a new hook pattern
- **Manage All** — Link to the hook patterns list table
- **Hook Reference** — Table of all available hooks with descriptions and enabled status

## Conditionals

Settings for the [Conditional Logic](/features/conditional-logic) system. Each condition group can be independently toggled:

| Group | Controls |
|-------|----------|
| **Visibility** | Lockdown, Screen Size, Browser & Device |
| **User** | User Status, User Role, Specific Users |
| **Schedule** | Date & Time scheduling |
| **Pro Conditions** | Cookie, Referral, ACF, MetaBox, Post Meta, User Meta |

Disabling a group removes its section from the Conditionals meta box in the editor across all post types.

## Integrations

Settings for third-party plugin integrations. Features are conditionally displayed based on which plugins are active.

## Implementation

The admin panel is implemented in `Aegis\Admin\ConditionalLogicSettings`:

- Pages are registered as hidden submenu pages under the Aegis menu
- Tab navigation is rendered via PHP with active state detection
- Each tab has a dedicated render method
- Styles are loaded from `src/Admin/css/admin-settings.css` and `src/Admin/css/hook-patterns.css`
