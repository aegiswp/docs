## Overview

Aegis enhances the WordPress Search block with a CSS-only full-screen search toggle for optimal performance.

## CSS-Only Search Toggle

The search block is enhanced with a pure CSS implementation that provides a full-screen search overlay:

- **No JavaScript** — Entirely CSS-driven
- **Full-screen overlay** — Covers the viewport for focused search
- **Keyboard accessible** — Escape key closes the overlay
- **Instant** — No loading or animation delay

## How to Add Search

### In the Header

1. Edit your **Header** template part in the Site Editor.
2. Add a **Search** block.
3. The CSS-only toggle is automatically applied.

### In Content

Add a Search block anywhere in your content. The standard inline search form is used outside of the header context.

## Search Block Styles

Default search block styles from `theme.json`:

```
Padding: 0 on all sides
Block Gap: XXS (8px)
```

## Search Templates

Aegis includes a dedicated search results template (`search.html`) that displays results in a clean, readable layout.

For WooCommerce sites, a separate product search template (`search-product.html`) is also available.

## Aegis Docs Search

The [Aegis Docs plugin](/plugins/aegis-docs) adds a dedicated documentation search with:

- REST API-powered search (`/aegis-docs/v1/search`)
- Space-scoped search filtering
- Relevance-based ordering
- Excerpt generation
