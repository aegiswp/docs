## Overview

Every aspect of Aegis is engineered for speed. The theme is designed to achieve excellent Core Web Vitals scores out of the box.

## Zero Default Assets

Aegis loads **zero CSS and zero JavaScript** by default. All styling is managed through `theme.json` and the WordPress block system:

- No monolithic stylesheet
- No jQuery dependency
- No render-blocking scripts

## Conditional Asset Loading

Stylesheets and scripts are loaded only when required by a page:

- **Block-specific CSS** — Each block's styles are loaded only when that block is present
- **Feature-specific JS** — JavaScript modules (e.g., Slider, Modal) load only when their blocks are used
- **Integration CSS** — Plugin integration styles load only when the plugin is active

## Optimized CSS Framework

The minimal CSS framework addresses common core CSS issues while maintaining performance:

- Styles are scoped to specific blocks and features
- No unused CSS is delivered to the browser
- Critical styles are inlined where possible

## Font Loading

Fonts are optimized for performance:

- **Local hosting** — All fonts are served from the theme (no external requests to Google Fonts)
- **Variable fonts** — Single font files cover all weights (300–900)
- **WOFF2 format** — Maximum compression
- **Conditional loading** — Fonts load only when selected in Site Editor → Styles
- **`font-display: block`** — Prevents layout shift from font swapping

## Image Optimization

- **Lazy loading** — Video blocks include lazy loading support
- **WebP format** — Recommended for all pattern images
- **No fixed dimensions** — Images use responsive sizing
- **Border radius** — Applied via CSS tokens, not image manipulation

## Interactivity API

Custom blocks use the WordPress Interactivity API instead of traditional JavaScript:

- **Server-side rendering** — Initial HTML is rendered on the server
- **Progressive enhancement** — Content is visible before JS loads
- **Module scripts** — Loaded as ES modules with automatic deferred loading
- **Shared state** — Efficient state management across blocks

## No Build Process

Aegis has no unnecessary build process for the theme itself:

- Theme files are production-ready as shipped
- No compilation step required for deployment
- Reduces complexity and potential build-related issues

## Transition Performance

The global transition defaults are optimized for perceived performance:

```css
--wp--custom--transition--property: all;
--wp--custom--transition--duration: 0.1s;
--wp--custom--transition--timing-function: ease-in;
```

The 100ms duration is fast enough to feel instant while providing smooth visual feedback.

## Measuring Performance

To verify Aegis performance on your site:

1. **Lighthouse** — Run a Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools
2. **PageSpeed Insights** — Test at [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
3. **WebPageTest** — Detailed waterfall analysis at [webpagetest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org/)
4. **Core Web Vitals** — Monitor via Google Search Console

## Tips for Maintaining Performance

1. **Use patterns** — Pre-optimized layouts maintain performance
2. **Minimize plugins** — Each plugin adds potential overhead
3. **Optimize images** — Use WebP, appropriate sizes, and lazy loading
4. **Use object caching** — Redis or Memcached for database query caching
5. **Enable CDN** — Serve static assets from a CDN
6. **Avoid custom CSS** — Use `theme.json` tokens instead of additional stylesheets
