## Prerequisites

Before installing Aegis, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- A modern web browser

<Note>
Some features may require the latest WordPress version or the [Gutenberg plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) for full functionality.

## Installation Methods

  <Tab title="WordPress Admin">

    wp theme install /path/to/aegis.zip --activate
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify Installation

After activation, confirm Aegis is running correctly:

1. Visit your site's frontend — you should see the default Aegis layout.
2. Navigate to **Appearance → Editor** to access the Site Editor.
3. Check **Appearance → Editor → Patterns** to browse the included patterns.

<Check>
Aegis is now installed and ready to use. Visit the [Site Editor guide](/core/site-editor) to start customizing your site.
</Check>

## Updating Aegis

Aegis includes a built-in theme updater that checks for new releases on GitHub. When an update is available:

1. You'll see a notification in **Appearance → Themes**
2. Click **Update Now** to install the latest version

<Warning>
Always backup your site before updating. If you've made customizations through the Site Editor, your customizations are stored in the database and will persist through updates.
</Warning>

## Child Theme

For custom code modifications, use the official [Aegis Child Theme](https://github.com/aegiswp/theme-child) rather than editing the parent theme directly. This ensures your customizations survive theme updates.

```bash
# Clone the child theme
git clone https://github.com/aegiswp/theme-child.git

# Upload to /wp-content/themes/aegis-child/
# Activate via Appearance → Themes
```

See the [Child Themes guide](/development/child-themes) for detailed instructions.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| White screen after activation | Ensure PHP 7.4+ and WordPress 6.6+ are installed |
| Patterns not appearing | Clear any caching plugins and check **Appearance → Editor → Patterns** |
| Styles not loading | Verify the theme folder is named `aegis` (not `aegis-main` or similar) |
| Update not showing | The updater requires the `repo` config in `functions.php` — do not remove it |
